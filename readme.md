# Simple Compiler for Custom Language

This project implements a simple compiler in JavaScript for a custom programming language. The compiler consists of multiple components including lexer, parser, code generator, and runner. It takes input code written in the custom language, processes it, generates executable JavaScript code, and then executes it.

## Components

### 1. Lexer

The `lexer` function performs lexical analysis on the input code, breaking it down into tokens. It recognizes various types of tokens including keywords, identifiers, numbers, and operators.

### 2. Parser

The `parser` function takes the tokens generated by the lexer and constructs an abstract syntax tree (AST) representing the structure of the code. It identifies declarations and print statements, and generates the corresponding AST nodes.

### 3. Code Generator

The `codeGen` function traverses the AST and generates executable JavaScript code based on the structure of the AST nodes. It maps different types of nodes to JavaScript code constructs such as variable declarations and console logging.

### 4. Compiler

The `compiler` function orchestrates the compilation process by invoking the lexer, parser, and code generator functions sequentially. It takes the input code, processes it through the various stages of compilation, and returns the generated JavaScript code.

### 5. Runner

The `runner` function evaluates and executes the generated JavaScript code using the `eval` function. It takes the generated JavaScript code as input and executes it within the current JavaScript runtime environment.

## Usage

To use the compiler, follow these steps:

1. **Input Code**: Modify the `code` variable with your custom code written in the specified format of the custom language.

2. **Compilation**: Call the `compiler` function with your input code as an argument. This will compile the code and generate executable JavaScript code.

3. **Execution**: Invoke the `runner` function with the generated JavaScript code as an argument. This will execute the compiled code.

```javascript
const code = `
consider x = 10
consider y = 20

consider sum = x + y
print sum
`;
const exec = compiler(code);
runner(exec);
```

## Custom Language Syntax

The custom language supported by this compiler includes:

- Variable declaration using the `consider` keyword.
- Arithmetic operations (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) between variables and literals.
- Printing variables or expressions using the `print` keyword.

## Notes

- This compiler is designed for educational purposes and may not handle all edge cases or production-level requirements.
- The use of the `eval` function in the `runner` function can be potentially unsafe, especially with untrusted code.
